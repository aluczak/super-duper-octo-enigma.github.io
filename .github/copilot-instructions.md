# Project context
The goal of this project is to develop a web application that allows users to list pokemons and view their details. The application will fetch data from the public PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/) and display it in a user-friendly interface. Users should be able to search for pokemons by name, view a list of pokemons with their images, and click on a pokemon to see more detailed information such as abilities, types, and stats.

# Architecture
- The application will be a single-page application (SPA) built using React.
- The application will follow a component-based architecture using React.
- State management will be handled using React's built-in state and context API.
- Routing will be managed using React Router to navigate between the list view and detailed view of pokemons.

# Coding guidelines
- The application should be built using React.
- Use latest React for the frontend development.
- Use functional components and React hooks whenever possible.
- Use Axios or Fetch API for making HTTP requests to the PokeAPI.

# Assumptions
- The application will be hosted on Github Pages.

# Scope
- Create a welcome page with a brief introduction to the application.
- Fetch and display a list of pokemons with their images.
- Implement pagination or infinite scroll to load more pokemons.
- Implement a search functionality to filter pokemons by name.
- Create a detailed view for each pokemon showing its abilities, types, and stats.
- Allow user to select favorite pokemons and store them in local storage.
